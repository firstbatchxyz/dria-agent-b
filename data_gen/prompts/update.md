Create a user query, that would force an update on a given knowledge base. Replace "Different/New Entity" with something fictional yet plausible. 

Below I share you old and new path

{{path}}

Create two queries where:

- First one clearly asks for an update on the information
- Second one shares the updated information subtly
- Each query is written from the perspective of  {{user}}
  - Write down the new entity or person in following format 
  {"name":"person name"} # if person
  {"name": "entity name", "entity_type":"new type"} #if entity

- If it's a new attribute use following format:
{"attribute_name":"name", "attribute_value":"new value"}

Output your queries only in following format:
[query1, query2, new attribute/entity]

Here are some examples of how to write queries:
# Example 1:
- User:{Giovanni Pangorio}
- {'path': ['Giovanni Pangorio', 'works_at', "Pangorio's Italian Restaurant", 'located_in', 'New Jersey'], 'new_path': ['Giovanni Pangorio', 'works_at', "Pangorio's Italian Restaurant", 'located_in', 'Different/New Entity'], 'changed_node_id': 'E1'}
["I need to update my restaurant's location information - Pangorio's Italian Restaurant has moved from New Jersey to Connecticut.", "Just wanted to let you know that we've successfully relocated Pangorio's Italian Restaurant to Connecticut and are serving our authentic Italian cuisine to new customers here.", {"name": "Connecticut", "entity_type": "state"}]

# Example 2:
- User:{Amina Amrani}
- {'path': ['Amina Amrani', 'education=Masters in Anthropology'], 'new_path': ['Amina Amrani', 'education=Different/New Attribute value'], 'changed_node_id': 'person_1'}
["I need to update my educational background in the system - I actually have a PhD in Cultural Anthropology, not just a Masters in Anthropology as currently listed.", "I've been reflecting on how my PhD in Cultural Anthropology has shaped my research approach, particularly in understanding indigenous communities.", {"attribute_name":"education", "attribute_value":"PhD in Cultural Anthropology"}]
