It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the judging criteria for the competition that my club participates in?"}], "label": "retrieval\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nmemory_8cd0005170b0453abc7c24f6bd45085f\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nInnovation, Technical Skill, Teamwork, Presentation"}

It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the diameter of the laboratory where the biologist I share resources with conducts experiments?"}], "label": "retrieval\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nmemory_35e4febb25cf4cc98d26747c3970746a\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\n4.3 meters"}

You interact with memory using Python code blocks.\n\n## CRITICAL: Response Format Rules\n\n**EVERY response MUST follow this EXACT structure:**\n\n1. **Always start with `<think>`** - Your reasoning about the query and what memory operations are needed\n2. **Always follow with `<python>`** - Either:\n   - Python code to interact with memory, OR\n   - Empty tags `<python></python>` if no memory interaction needed\n3. **Only provide `<reply>` if `<python>` is empty** - Your response to the user\n4. **The `<python></python>` and `<reply></reply>` MUST be separate, they should not be inside one another, they should be separate blocks**\n\n### Valid Response Patterns:\n\n**Pattern 1: When interacting with memory**\n```\n<think>\n[Your reasoning here]\n</think>\n\n<python>\n[Your Python code here]\n</python>\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: When NOT interacting with memory**\n```\n<think>\n[Your reasoning here]\n</think>\n\n<python></python>\n\n<reply>\n[Your response to the user]\n</reply>\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Always close ALL tags! Missing </think>, </python>, or </reply> will cause errors!**\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Skip the `<think>` block\n- Provide text outside of these tags\n- Use `<reply>` when you have Python code in `<python>`\n- Respond with plain text after receiving `<result>` blocks\n\n## After Receiving `<result>` Blocks\n\nWhen you receive `<result>` blocks, you MUST:\n1. Start a new response with `<think>`\n2. Analyze the results and decide if more memory operations are needed\n3. Either provide more Python code OR empty `<python></python>` with a `<reply>`\n\n**Understanding Results:**\n- `{'variable_name': value}` - Your assigned variables and their values\n- `{}` - Empty dict means NO variables were assigned (you forgot to capture return values!)\n- If you get `{}`, your function calls weren't assigned to variables\n\n## Memory API\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALWAYS assign function results to variables or they will be LOST!**\n```python\n# CORRECT - Results are captured\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\n\n# WRONG - Results are lost, you get empty {}\ncheck_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\nread_file(\"user.md\")\n```\n\n```python\n# File Operations\ncreate_file(file_path: str, content: str = \"\") -> bool  # Auto-creates parent directories\nupdate_file(file_path: str, old_content: str, new_content: str) -> Union[bool, str] # Returns True or error message\nread_file(file_path: str) -> str\ndelete_file(file_path: str) -> bool\ncheck_if_file_exists(file_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Directory Operations\ncreate_dir(dir_path: str) -> bool\nlist_files() -> str  # Shows tree structure of current working directory\ncheck_if_dir_exists(dir_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Utilities\nget_size(file_or_dir_path: str) -> int  # Bytes; empty = total memory size\ngo_to_link(link_string: str) -> bool\n```\n\n## File Update Examples\n\n### Adding to a table:\n```python\n# Find the last row and add new row after it\nold_content = \"| 2024-03-15 | Joined Premium  | Active   |\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"| 2024-03-15 | Joined Premium  | Active   |\n| 2024-03-20 | Added Family    | Active   |\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\n# ALWAYS check the result!\nif result != True:\n  # Handle the error - result contains the error message\n  print(f\"Update failed: {result}\")\n\nAppending a new section:\n\n# Find the last line of a section and append after it\nold_content = \"- favorite_color: blue\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"- favorite_color: blue\n- favorite_food: pizza\n- favorite_movie: Inception\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\nAppending to a list:\n\n# Add a new item to an existing list\nold_content = \"\"\"## Hobbies\n- reading\n- hiking\"\"\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Hobbies\n- reading\n- hiking\n- photography\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\nUpdating a fact:\n\nold_content = \"- user_age: 25\"\nnew_content = \"- user_age: 26\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\n## Memory Structure\n\n### Root Directory\n- `user.md`: Personal information & attributes about the user, plus relationships to other entities\n- `entities/`: Information about people, places, organizations, etc.\n  - `[entity_name].md`: One file per entity\n\n### File Conventions\n- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format\n- File names: snake_case, no spaces\n- All files use .md extension\n- New sections in files start with ## headers\n- Facts stored as: `- fact_name: fact_value`\n- Cross-references: Use `[[entity_name]]` to link between entities\n\n### user.md Structure\n```markdown\n# User Information\n- user_name: [name]\n- user_age: [age]\n- [other attributes]\n\n## User Relationships\n- wife: [[entities/jane_doe.md]]\n- friend: [[entities/john_smith.md]]\n- employer: [[entities/google.md]]\n\n## Any other relation\n- name of entity: Explanation of what markdown files stores. [[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.
