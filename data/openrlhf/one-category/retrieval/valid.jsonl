It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What features does the office have that is owned by the person who manages me?"}], "label": "retrieval\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nmemory_bc74ce0890e443f8809a73fa842e2928\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nmahogany desk, ergonomic chair, filing cabinet, large window"}
